To address the challenge of distributed transactions, the Saga pattern is the most common solution for managing data consistency across services. A saga is a sequence of local transactions that are coordinated to execute a complete business process. Each step in the saga is a local, atomic transaction within a single service. Upon successful completion, it triggers the next step in the sequence, typically by publishing an event or sending a command.

The key to the Saga pattern's atomicity is its handling of failures. If any local transaction in the sequence fails, the saga executes a series of compensating transactions to undo the work of the preceding, successfully completed steps. For example, if a CreateOrder saga involves ProcessPayment, UpdateInventory, and CreateShipment, and the CreateShipment step fails, compensating transactions for RefundPayment and RestoreInventory would be executed. This approach does not provide the immediate consistency of an ACID transaction but instead achieves eventual consistency, where the system converges to a consistent state over time.

There are two primary approaches to implementing sagas:

1. **Choreography**: This is a decentralized approach where services communicate directly with each other by publishing and subscribing to events. There is no central coordinator.
   
2. **Orchestration**: This is a centralized approach where a dedicated orchestrator service is responsible for managing the entire saga. The orchestrator sends commands to each participant service, waits for a reply, and decides the next step in the workflow. If a step fails, the orchestrator is responsible for triggering the necessary compensating transactions. This approach is easier to monitor and manage for complex workflows but introduces the orchestrator as a potential single point of failure and creates a degree of coupling between the participant services and the orchestrator.
