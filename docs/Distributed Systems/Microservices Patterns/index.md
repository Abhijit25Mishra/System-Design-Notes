# Microservices Patterns

This section details common architectural patterns used in microservices to address challenges like data management and distributed transactions.

## Key Patterns

- `Database per Service pattern` — Discusses the principle of each microservice owning its private database, including advantages, challenges, and implications for data consistency.
- `SAGA pattern` — Explores how to manage distributed transactions across multiple services to maintain data consistency, covering both choreography and orchestration approaches.

Use these patterns to build robust and scalable microservices architectures.
