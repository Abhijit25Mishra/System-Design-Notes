# Distributed Systems

Collection of architecture patterns, domain-driven design notes, event sourcing, communication patterns, and practical guidance for building distributed systems.

Key topics in this folder:

- `Architectural choice` — monolithic vs microservices trade-offs and decision guidance.
- `Domain Driven Design` — strategic and tactical DDD patterns for defining service boundaries.
- `Database per Service pattern` — data ownership, pros/cons, and operational considerations.
- `SAGA pattern` — handling distributed transactions and eventual consistency.
- `Event Sourcing` — storing events as the source of truth and reconstructing state.
- `Inter-Service Communication` — synchronous vs asynchronous styles, gRPC, REST, message queues, and trade-offs.
- `When to create or extend a service` — guidelines for service decomposition.

Use these pages to help design, model, and operate robust distributed systems.
