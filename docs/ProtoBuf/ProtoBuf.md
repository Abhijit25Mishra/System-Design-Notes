Originated within Google as an internal project. The primary motivation was to create a more efficient and robust mechanism for communication between Google's vast number of internal services. Full form is "Protocol Buffers".

XML was a common choice for data interchange but its performance characteristics were inadequate for scale and latency requirement of Google's infrastructure. JSON gained popularity for its simplicity and direct mapping to JavaScript objects, but as a text-based format, it still carries significant size and parsing overhead compared to optimized binary formats.

All data structure in protobuf are called messages.

## Core Philosophy 
The design of Protocol Buffer is built upon a distinct philosophy that prioritizes machine to machine efficiency and contract based design over given readability and ad hoc flexibility. This philosophy is embodied in three core principles.

1. **Schema-Driven** :  messages must be explicitly defined in special files with a dot protobuff extension These files are written using Interface Definition Language that describes the fields of a message their data type and their unique identifying numbers. This schema first approach enforces a strict contract between communicating parties ensuring type safety and data consistency. **This contract becomes the single source of truth for the data structure**

2. **language-agnostic and platform-neutral** : The .proto file serves as a universal, language-independent contract. From this single definition, the Protobuf compiler, protoc, generates native source code for a wide array of programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, Go, C#, Dart, and Ruby. The generated code provides a strongly-typed, easy-to-use API for creating, manipulating, serializing, and deserializing the defined messages. This allows services written in different languages to communicate seamlessly, as long as they are compiled from the same .proto definition.

3. **performance-oriented** : Design is optimized for speed and compactness. The format is a dense binary representation which is significantly smaller than the equivalent text based format like jason or XML Instead of using human readable fields in the payload protobuff uses unique integer tags to identify fields further reducing size It employs efficient encoding techniques such as variable length integers to represent numbers compactly the combination of these technique results in smaller payload which consume less of everything and results in faster serialization and deserialization.

| required Keyword   | Supported, but strongly discouraged for new designs.                                           | Removed. Use of required is a compile-time error.                                                                                                           | Not supported. Migrated required fields use a special feature set.                                            |
| Field Presence     | Explicit presence for optional fields. A has_ method is generated to check if a field was set. | Implicit presence for scalar fields by default (cannot distinguish unset from default value). optional keyword was later added to enable explicit presence. | Explicit presence is the default for all singular fields, providing clear tracking of whether a field is set. |
| Default Values     | Custom default values can be specified using [default = value].                                | Custom default values are not supported. Fields default to a type-specific zero value (0, empty string, false).                                             | Explicit default values are reintroduced.                                                                     |
| Enums              | The first enum value can be non-zero.                                                          | The first enum value must be zero, which serves as the default.                                                                                             | The first enum value must be zero.                                                                            |
| Extensions         | Natively supported as a core feature.                                                          | Not supported (though Any provides an alternative).                                                                                                         | Reintroduced as a feature.                                                                                    |
